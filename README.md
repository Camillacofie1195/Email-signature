# Email-signature
Email signature which I designed from scratch. I wanted to design a simple email signature to be implemented on Microsoft Outlook. I really love the design that I came up with but the code itself is problematic for a few reasons 

1. Some of the CSS is not displayed because the CSS is not written inline, Some email clients do not support certain CSS attributes
2. Microsoft Outlook does not render <div> well
3. Images not displaying at all because they were saved in a folder on my desktop 

I have put the exisiting files on here so that my revised code looks the same or similar to the orginal code and that I have the original code to refer back to if needed
